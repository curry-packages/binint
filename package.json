    "description":
      "This package contains libraries with data types for a binary
       representation of natural and integer numbers.
       The advantage of this algebraic definition in contrast to built-in
       integers is the possibility to use them also for narrowing, i.e.,
       functional logic programming. Since the operations are also quite
       efficient compared to a simple Peano representations, this library
       is also the basis of the implementation of integers in the Curry
       implementation KiCS2.",
